# Telegram-Messages-Forwarder

This project is a **Telegram message forwarding bot**. It listens for messages from users, groups, and channels in real-time and forwards them to a specified chat.

‚≠ê **Please leave a star for the project.**  
This project is free and open-source. Your support with a star helps motivate future development! ‚≠ê  

## Setup

To install and set up the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Er-Simon/Telegram-Messages-Forwarder Telegram-Messages-Forwarder
cd Telegram-Messages-Forwarder
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

1. **Create a Telethon Session**:  
   The program will guide you through creating a Telethon session. You will need your `api_id` and `api_hash`, which you can obtain from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).
   
2. **Select Source and Destination Chats**:  
   After creating the session, the bot will display all chats your account has access to. You can then specify:
   - A **destination chat** (where messages will be forwarded).  
     **Note**: You must have permission to send messages in the destination chat.
   - One or more **source chats** (from which the bot will listen for messages and forward them).

## Run

To start the bot:

```bash
python3 main.py
```
